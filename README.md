# Introduction
This repository is a containerized solution for deploying JupyterHub using Docker. Both JupyterHub and the user environments run in Docker containers, ensuring sudo rights for each user. The users must have a user account on the server in order to be able to log into JupyterHub.


# Using JupyterLab
To access the Lab go to https://192.168.0.177:8000 and log in using your username and password (same username and password as for your user account on the server). You will be redirected to your workspace
